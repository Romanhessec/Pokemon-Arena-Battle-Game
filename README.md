# Pokemon-Arena-Battle-Game

Built a customized Pokemon game, simulating an Arena-type battle of multiple trainers. The battles were simulated using text-file input for the 
different types of pokemons/battle items and the results were printed using a Logger.
Implemented fully in Java, using various OOP and Design Patterns ideas, as well as multi-threading.
